A simple adventure game by {who?} based on a simple adventure game engine by [Adam Smith](https://github.com/rndmcnlly).

Code requirements:
- **4+ scenes based on `AdventureScene`**: Demo1, Demo2, Demo3, Demo4
- **2+ scenes *not* based on `AdventureScene`**: Outro, Outro2
- **2+ methods or other enhancement added to the adventure game engine to simplify my scenes**:
    - Enhancement 1: push- makes image go up then down.
    - Enhancement 2: shake- shakes an image back and forth.

Experience requirements:
- **4+ locations in the game world**: Demo1(Dark Room), Demo2(Campfire Room), Demo3(Button Room), Demo4(Vending Machine Room)
- **2+ interactive objects in most scenes**: Every room has a door and at least one thing.  Like first room with torch, door, and hiddent whopper.  Campfire room has campfire, two doors, and a dude.
- **Many objects have `pointerover` messages**: Doors all have descriptions where they go when pointer over.  Button has Do Not Press when pointer over.
- **Many objects have `pointerdown` effects**: Doors open and lead to next room when pointer down.  Torch gets picked up on pointer down.
- **Some objects are themselves animated**: Button shakes up and down when it is pushed.  Doors all open with animation and sound effect.
